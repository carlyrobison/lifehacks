## Problem Statement

I want to find the optimal biking path to and from two points on a map. The two directions will probably not be the same. The ease of biking a given block is determined by:
- Incline
- Road condition
- Distance

In addition, some streets are two way stops, and some are four way. Four way are great because we can roll right through on a bike, but two way when we are the stopping traffic is much scarier. There is one street that we don't want to cross as a two way stop.
