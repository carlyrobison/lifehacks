# Grand Canyon Trip Planner Solver

Job of this software: iteratively build a Grand Canyon itinerary that maps River Miles (RM) to Nights, planning an itinerary.

## Constraints

Taking inspiration from CAD software, nights are RED if they are overdefined, BLUE if they are underdefined, and BLACK if they are fully defined.

## Conventions

By convention Night 0 is the ranger check at Lee's Ferry and RM 0.0 is Lee's Ferry.
